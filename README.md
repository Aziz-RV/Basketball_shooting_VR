# SHOOT_VR
This is a VR-game for Basketball shooting made for my Virtual reality major project.
1. The app starts in the start menu and the user should point the start-boutton to start the game.
2. The game starts with a position to shoot the ball.
3. You can change the position of shooting by pointing the new position using the controller.
